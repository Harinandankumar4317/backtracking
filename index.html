    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you
        make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you
        made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of
        choices, your final state is a <i>goal state;</i> if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though
        it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with
        the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can <i>backtrack</i> to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your
        <i>most recent</i> choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options,
        revoke
        thechoice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options
        left,
        there are no good leaves to be found
    </p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="./treesearch.gif" alt="">
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices
        we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell
        us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called
        <i>depth-first
            tree searching.</i>)

    <p><b>
            <font size="+1">The backtracking algorithm.</font>
        </b></p>
    <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>
    <pre><font color="#660000" size="+1">
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }
        </font>
    </pre>
    <p>
        <font size="+1">Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a</font>
        <i> boolean</i> function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm.If <font color="#660000" size="+1">
            <code> solve(n)</code>
        </font>is true, that means node
        <font color="#660000" size="+1"><code> n </code></font> is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the
        nodes on a path from
        the root to some goal node. We say that <font color="#660000" size="+1"><code>n</code></font> is solvable. If
        <font color="#660000" size="+1"><code> solve(n)</code></font> is false, then there is no path that includes
        <font color="#660000" size="+1"><code>n</code></font> to any goal node.
        </font>
    </p>
    <p>How does this work?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node <font color="#660000" size="+1"><code>n</code></font> is solvable
        (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is
        test whether any child of <font color="#660000" size="+1"><code>n</code></font> is solvable. This is done
        recursively, on each child of <font color="#660000" size="+1"><code>n</code></font>. In the above code, this
        is done by the lines</p>
    <pre><font color="#660000" size="+1">
        for each child c of n {
            if solve(c) succeeds, return true
        }
        return false
        </font></pre>
    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if
        the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by
        the lines</p>
